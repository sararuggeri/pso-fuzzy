# **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in Python**

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for solving optimization problems. 
The PSO is a population-based stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling.

## Contents

* main.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation and execution of PSO.
* softpy: a Python library for soft computing ([@AndreaCampagner](https://github.com/AndreaCampagner/softpy))
* README: Overview and instructions.

## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository

  `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pso-python.git
    cd pso-python`

3. Install Requirements: this implementation uses standard Python libraries. If using Jupyter:

`pip install notebook matplotlib numpy`

3. Run the Notebook

`jupyter notebook main.ipynb`
